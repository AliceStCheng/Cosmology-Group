# Cosmology Group Project

These are the files for my cosmology group project, which is a 10 week project looking into prominent cosmological theories about the evolution of the universe and its relation with dark energy. The calculations were done using numerical integration methods such as Trapezium rule and the Simpson rule.
The report from the results has obtained the one of the highest grades in the year.
