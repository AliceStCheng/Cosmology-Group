Trapeziumrule(f(), range, step);
Using range and step calculate the
integration point;

for(Start at the first integration point; Not last integration point; Advance to next intrgration point ){
  if(First integration point){
    Save first integration point as prevX;
  }
  else{
    Use prevX and current integration point
    to add to the value of the integral;
    Save a the current integration point as prevX
  }
}
Use prevX and the last point ;
return Return the value of the integral;
